Welcome to the Airbnb House Renting Telegram Bot! This project is a Telegram bot that uses webhooks and Azure Functions to assist users in finding and renting the perfect Airbnb property. The bot also leverages Azure Blob Storage to store and manage property data. 🌟

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/primanator/RentBot.git`

2. Create a new Telegram bot by talking to the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) and receive the bot HTTP API token.

3. Set up your Azure Function and Azure Blob Storage accounts. For local testing of the Function, add the `"AzureWebJobsStorage"` value to the `local.settings.json` project file.

4. Set the Azure Function `authorizationLevel` to `function` and trigger to `POST` message.

5. Publish your Azure Function to the cloud.

6. Use Postman to register webhook, make a POST request to `https://api.telegram.org/bot***/setWebhook`, where `***` symbols are the bot HTTP API token. The message body should be raw JSON and include:
- `"url"`: The actual Azure Function URL with token.
- `"allowed_updates"`: An array of messages for the function to receive.
- `"drop_pending_updates": true`.

7. To see the state of the webhook, make a POST request to `https://api.telegram.org/bot***/getWebhookinfo` with an empty body.

8. To delete the webhook, make a POST request to `https://api.telegram.org/bot***/deleteWebhook` with an empty body.

9. Start using the bot on Telegram! 🎉

For more information on the Telegram webhook setup, refer to the [Telegram API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook).
